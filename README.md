# R-Techniques
This repository is a showcase of various R techniques for exploratory data analysis, useful visualization techniques, and predictive analysis processes.  

## Graphing 
When it comes to data visualization, it is important to understand when to use types of graphs. My preferred way to graph in R is with **ggplot2** due to the various interactive techiques and type of coding that is used for that library. Below are graphs I have produced and why I have produced them. Check out the codes in my other files. 

###### BarGraphs
Bargraphs are useful for defining qualitative data. This particular graph charts specific definitions used by colleges and univeristies across Massachusetts to define their "wellness" programs on campus. The second image is a grouped bargraph that shows the breakdown of Public University definitions of "wellness" verses Private Universities. These simple bargraphs are helpful when working with smaller qualitative data as it is simple to understand and does not confuse the reader like a pie chart or donut graph may.
