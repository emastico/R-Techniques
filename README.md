# R-Techniques
This repository is a showcase of various R techniques for exploratory data analysis, useful visualization techniques, and predictive analysis processes.  

## Graphing 
When it comes to data visualization, it is important to understand when to use types of graphs. My preferred way to graph in R is with **ggplot2** due to the various interactive techiques and type of coding that is used for that library. Below are graphs I have produced and why I have produced them. Check out the codes in my other files. 

###### BarGraphs
Bargraphs are useful for defining qualitative data. This particular graph charts specific definitions used by colleges to define their "wellness" programs on campus.

Grouped bargraphs also are useful in qualitative visualization for smaller data sets. Here we see the definitions between public and private universities
